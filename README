sml-bdb - Berkeley DB binding for Standard ML.

See t.* files for example.


N.B. for PolyML
Get function is not threads safe.
DB_DBT_MALLOC is not used to get DBT (see Berkeley DB documentation).
To protect Get function use mutex when you have access for a database from many threads.

Tip.
Do not dbVerify and dbOpen with same db handler.
